Project Objective

To evaluate the sales performance of "Awesome Chocolates" by tracking Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) including Total Sales, Cost, and Profitability, while identifying underperforming sales representatives to improve Month-over-Month (MoM) growth.

Key Insights

Revenue Risk: While Total Sales stand at $34M, the company is experiencing a -10.8% Month-over-Month decline, requiring immediate strategic adjustment.

Profit Stability: Despite the revenue drop, the company maintains a strong 60.3% profit margin, indicating effective cost management ($13.52M Total Cost).

Sales Performance: Kelci Walkden is the top performer ($1.51M Sales). However, lower-tier performers like Beverie Moffet are missing critical operational targets (LBS %), highlighted by the red indicators in the salesperson matrix.
