This Power BI dashboard was developed to enable executive leadership to track real-time (or near real-time) operational efficiency and identify key drivers of customer churn using complex DAX measures.

## Project Objective
To evaluate the sales performance of "Awesome Chocolates" by tracking Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) including Total Sales, Cost, and Profitability, while identifying underperforming sales representatives to improve Month-over-Month (MoM) growth.

## Key Insights
* **Revenue Risk:** While Total Sales stand at $34M, the company is experiencing a **-10.8% Month-over-Month decline**, requiring immediate strategic adjustment.
* **Profit Stability:** Despite the revenue drop, the company maintains a strong **60.3% profit margin**, indicating effective cost management ($13.52M Total Cost).
* **Sales Performance:** Kelci Walkden is the top performer ($1.51M Sales). However, lower-tier performers like Beverie Moffet are missing critical operational targets (LBS %), highlighted by the red indicators in the salesperson matrix.
