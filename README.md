### I. The Business Problem (Logic First)

Prior to this project, the "Awesome Chocolates" sales reporting relied on decentralized data sources, leading to a significant time lag and inconsistent metrics across regional teams. The lack of a unified view hindered proactive management intervention.

The objective was to evaluate the sales performance by tracking Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), including **Total Sales, Cost, and Profitability**, with the ultimate goal of identifying underperforming sales representatives and specific product lines to improve Month-over-Month (MoM) growth.

### II. Key Insights & Business Impact (The Result)

The consolidated dashboard immediately drove the following critical insights:

| Finding | Impact/Recommendation |
Finding,Impact/Recommendation
"Revenue Risk: While Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales stand at $34M, the company is experiencing a significant 10.6% Month-over-Month decline, requiring immediate strategic adjustment.","Action: Prioritize analysis on high-volume, low-margin products identified on the Product Deep-Dive Tab to optimize pricing strategy and stabilize monthly sales."
"Profit Stability: Despite the revenue drop, the company maintains a strong 60.35% profit margin, indicating effective cost management ($13.52M Total Cost).","Action: Leadership is advised to focus intervention on sales and revenue generation, leveraging the high margin to support increased marketing spend."
"Sales Performance: [NAME_OF_TOP_PERFORMER] is the top performer ([SALES_FIGURE] Sales). However, lower-tier performers like [NAME_OF_BOTTOM_PERFORMER] are missing critical operational targets (LOS X), highlighted by the red indicators in the salesperson matrix.","Action: Implement targeted coaching and training for the bottom 20% of the sales team, using the performance metrics available in the dashboard."

| **Revenue Risk:** While Total Sales stand at $*[INSERT\_TOTAL\_SALES\_FIGURE]$,\* the company is experiencing a **$*$[INSERT\_MO M\_DECLINE\_%]$* MoM decline**, requiring immediate strategic adjustment. | **Action:** Prioritize analysis on high-volume, low-margin products identified on the **Product Deep-Dive Tab** to optimize pricing strategy. |
| **Profit Stability:** Despite the revenue drop, the company maintains a strong **$*$[INSERT\_PROFIT\_MARGIN]$* profit margin**, indicating effective cost management ($*$[INSERT\_TOTAL\_COST]$* Total Cost). | **Action:** Leadership is advised to focus intervention on sales and revenue generation rather than immediate cost-cutting. |
| **Sales Performance:** **$[NAME\_OF\_TOP\_PERFORMER]$** is the top performer ($*$[SALES\_FIGURE]$* Sales). However, lower-tier performers like **$[NAME\_OF\_BOTTOM\_PERFORMER]$** are missing critical operational targets (LOS X), highlighted by the red indicators in the salesperson matrix. | **Action:** Implement targeted coaching and training for the bottom 20% of the sales team, using the performance metrics available in the dashboard. |

### III. Technical Execution & Data Model (The Proof)

This project showcases end-to-end BI skills, including robust data modeling and advanced calculations:

  * **Data Model Architecture:** Implemented a **Star Schema** linking $[NUMBER]$ dimension tables (e.g., Date, Sales Rep, Product) to the central Fact Sales table, ensuring efficient query performance and relationship integrity.
  * **Data Transformation (Power Query / M-Code):** *[**YOU MUST WRITE THIS:** Describe ONE specific, non-trivial data cleaning or shaping step you performed. E.g., Unpivoting columns, handling errors, or custom column creation.]*
  * **DAX Measures Implementation:** *[**YOU MUST WRITE THIS:** Name ONE specific, complex DAX measure you created (e.g., MoM Change, Rolling Average, or Custom Rank) and briefly explain its logic.]*

### IV. Repository Contents

This repository is structured to provide full transparency of the project:

  * `/PowerBI_Source/`: Contains the final, anonymized **.pbix** file for full inspection of the data model and DAX code.
  * `/Data/`: Contains the anonymized raw data source file (`raw-data.csv`).
  * `/Screenshots/`: Contains high-resolution dashboard previews and GIFs.
